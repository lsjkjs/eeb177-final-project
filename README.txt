This directory is for the EEB-177 Final Project.

My final project will study the diversity of the clade Aves (birds) through time.
I will plot the diversity of Aves through time.  
I will also be looking at the genera of Aves and plot it in a stratigraphic format. 
Finally, I will utilize the occurrence data to calculate speciaiton and extinction rates through time. 

The file input-output_pseudocode.ipynb contains the pseudocode of how to input data for to output the plots.
The file loop_pseudocode.ipynb contains the pseudocode of how to manipulate data over a loop for the stratiographic plot.
