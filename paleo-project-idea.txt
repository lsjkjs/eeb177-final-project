Project Idea

I am interested in the diversity of the clade Aves (birds) through time. I would like look at the genera of the clade and study their speciation and extinction through itme.
*or study the clade Theropoda or Synapsida

I plan to use occurence data to study the diversity of the clade Aves. I plan to plot the stratigraphic record of the genera in the clade and utilize the occurrence data to calculate speciation and extinction rates through time. I will have to use Pyrate to do this.


1. Aves
Command:
tail -n +18 Aves_pbdb_data.csv | cut -d "," -f 6 | sort | uniq | wc -l
# of unique species:
2739

2. Theropoda
Command:
tail -n +18 Theropoda_pbdb_data.csv | cut -d "," -f 6 | sort | uniq | wc -l
# of unique species:
4174

3. Synapsida
Command:
tail -n +18 Synapsida_pbdb_data.csv | cut -d "," -f 6 | sort | uniq | wc -l
# of unique species:
